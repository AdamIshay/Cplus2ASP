# Cplus2ASP
Translating and solving CCalc action descriptions using answer set solvers

## Introduction
Cplus2ASP is a system designed to perform a modular translation of action descriptions written for CCalc into answer set programs. The current work comprises a suite of tools that translate CCalc action descriptions, solve the translated ASP programs, and produce answer sets similar to the models output by CCalc. If you're unfamiliar with CCalc, it's an implementation of the action language C+ (an extension of causal logic) that is very useful for describing and reasoning about time- and state-based domains using relatively intuitive syntax. For more information, check out the CCalc website using the link in the side bar. Our goal is to combine the user-friendliness of the CCalc language with the speed of modern answer set solvers to capture the best of both worlds.
